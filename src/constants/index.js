export const HERO_CONTENT = `My journey toward front-end development has been shaped by diverse experiences that have honed my technical skills and adaptability. After graduating in 2020, I pursued a software development course to strengthen my understanding of programming concepts and problem-solving. While initial roles and internships presented challenges, they provided valuable exposure and helped me transition into front-end development. Over time, I have developed expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and some Tailwind CSS. Through structured learning and hands-on projects, I have cultivated the ability to create effective, user-centric applications, demonstrating resilience and a commitment to continuous growth in the field of technology.`;
